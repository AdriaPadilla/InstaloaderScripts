# Instaloader Auxiliar Scripts

Here you'll find some scripts to make your live easier when working with Instaloader data. 

Please, see: [Instaloader](https://instaloader.github.io/)

- Json files to Excel
- Json files to SQL 
- Capture posts within a hashtag for certain dates **(Last update: Warning! Not working: 01/05/2020)**
- Profile posts to Excel (fast) <-- experimental (last update: 31/10/2020)
- Profile posts to Excel (easy) (last update: 20/11/2020)

Some of them have been created to process json files, other are made to amplify the capabilities of standard extractions, using Instaloader main class to add new fields to the capture.

## Updates 
- **20/11/2021**: improved **profile_posts_to_xlsx_easy** with a new method for data processing. Now it's faster and avoid Instagram quota limitations.
- 31/10/2021: improved **profile_posts_to_xlsx_fast** with ThreadPoolExecutor to multiprocess data from Instagram responses. This is an exploratory script.
